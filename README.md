## Library For Led Red,Green and Button

    Led & Button

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13,
  
  when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.

  The circuit:
  - LED attached from redLED,greenLED to ground

  Pull-Down
  - pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
    
  - 4K7 or 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

  - Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
    
    attached to redLED,greenLED.
